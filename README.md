# CT-simulator
The CT (computed tomography) simulator for the IT in medicine's lab.

A CT scan, also known as computed tomography scan, makes use of computer-processed combinations of many X-ray measurements taken from different angles to produce cross-sectional (tomographic) images (virtual "slices") of specific areas of a scanned object, allowing the user to see inside the object without cutting. Other terms include computed axial tomography (CAT scan) and computer aided tomography. [More about the CT scan on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan)

* Openness (conical system) / span (parallel system) of the emitter / detector system (l).
